<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Usman Shahid, and I am a web developer based in Lahore. I specialize in front-end development with expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a passion for creating responsive and user-friendly web experiences.</p>

<p>In addition to web development, I have experience working with various frameworks and libraries such as React.js and Bootstrap, which allow me to build dynamic and visually appealing websites.</p>

<p>I am also skilled in back-end technologies like Node.js and Express.js, enabling me to develop full-stack applications and RESTful APIs. I enjoy problem-solving and collaborating with teams to deliver high-quality solutions.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I love exploring new technologies, attending tech meetups, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
